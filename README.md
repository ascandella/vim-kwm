kwm

ViM syntax highlighting for editing kwmrc files for
[kwm](https://github.com/koekeishiya/kwm).

Note that kwm is being deprecated and the author "highly suggest"
suggest using the new [chunkwm](https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm) instead.

Once it's ready, I'll switch over. Until then, I'm super happy with KWM.
